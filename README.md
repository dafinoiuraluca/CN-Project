# Alzheimer's Assistance System
This is the repository used for the storage of the Alzheimer's Assistance System which is the solution for the project at Computer Networks at TUC-N.
Here, we have uploaded the code, PowerPoint presentation, documentation and demo images.

## Description
This is an Alzheimer's Assistance System, a project that falls into the Wearable Tech field of IoT, which allows caregivers to monitor the health status of Alzheimer's patients from distance.
It monitors the vital signs (pulse) of the patient and whether they have fallen or not using a pulse sensor, an accelerometer and a development board with Wi-Fi connectivity, all of them described bellow, in the Prerequisites part.
The data collected from the patients is stored on a Blynk server, where the caregiver can see them and gets an alert stating whether the patient has fallen or not (it is happy).

## Getting Started
These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.
